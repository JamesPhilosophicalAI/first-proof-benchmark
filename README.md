# First Proof Benchmark — Sage (SMF-Core)

This repository contains the official benchmark report and methodology for evaluating Sage (SMF-Core) on the First Proof research-level mathematics benchmark.

## Overview

First Proof is an independently created evaluation developed by leading mathematicians, featuring original research problems with encrypted solutions.

Philosophical AI evaluated Sage under autonomous conditions:

- No internet access  
- No cloud services  
- No API calls  
- No retrieval systems  
- No human mathematical input  

Result: 8/10 correct (80%)

Frontier-scale models (as reported by the First Proof team): 2/10 (20%)
